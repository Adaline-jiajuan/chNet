#' @description The TCGA  breast cancer gene expression data and tumor purity information data are used in our study.
#'The gene expression data are obtained from the TCGA database and collected  from mRNA expression
#'(Agilent G450 microarray). The breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that can be mainly divided into four molecular
#' subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, Basal-like and HER2-enriched.
#' The data only include expression measurements of genes that overlap
#' with the breast cancer pathway collected from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database.
#' The tumor purity information  of these samples inferred by ESTIMATION method, are collected from Aran et al (2015).
#' This data is an object of class list of length two. The first element (X) is the gene expression  data and the second element (purity)
#' is the tumor purity information data.
